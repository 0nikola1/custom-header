# CUSTOM HEADER

Custom Header adds enhancements and customization options to Home Assistant's Lovelace header. Custom Header is the successor to "Compact Custom Header".

## Features:

* Per user/device configs.
* Style and hide any element in the header.
* Dynamically style header elements based on entity states/attributes.
* Every config item can be templated with Jinja.
* Buttons can be hidden, turned into custom or templated text, and be placed in the options menu.
* Compact mode, a kiosk mode to remove header and sidebar, and footer mode to turn the header into a footer.
* Default/starting view.
* And much more.
  
## Important notes:

* Some options can remove your ability to edit with the UI, if you ever need to resore the default header just add "?disable_ch" to the end of your URL. Example "http://192.168.1.2:8123/lovelace/1?diable_ch"
* After using "Raw Config Editor" you will need to refresh the page to restore Custom Header.
