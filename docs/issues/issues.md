## Issues

Issues should be posted on [GitHub](https://github.com/maykar/custom-header/issues/new/choose) and preferably not on the forums. This makes tracking the issues easier and they will be resolved quicker.

You should always search [GitHub issues](https://github.com/maykar/custom-header/issues?q=is%3Aissue) (open and closed) as well as the forums to see if your issue has already been posted.

In order for me to investigate issues, please provide as much of the following info as possible:

- A copy/paste of your Custom Header config
- Any errors relevant to Custom Header found in the HA logs
- Any relevant errors found in your browsers dev console (usually found by hitting F12)
- The version of Home Assistant and Custom Header you are using
- The browser type your are using

When pasting in your config always place 3 backticks ` ``` ` above the first line and after the last line. Doing this will format it correctly so that I can find any errors in your config.

Issues that don't provide the necessary information may not get a reply and may be closed.
