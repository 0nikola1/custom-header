## Before posting an issue

- Be sure to read the [important notes section](#intro/notes) of the Docs.
- Disable Custom Header by temporarily removing it from your resouces to see if the issue persists. If it does, it's likely Custom Header is not the culprit.
- Issues should be posted on [GitHub](https://github.com/maykar/custom-header/issues/new/choose) and preferably not on the forums. This makes tracking the issues easier and they will be resolved quicker.
- Search [GitHub issues](https://github.com/maykar/custom-header/issues?q=is%3Aissue) (open and closed) as well as the forums to see if your issue has already been posted.

![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/maykar/custom-header?label=%20&style=flat-square) is the current version of Custom Header. Be sure that you are using the latest version by checking your browser's dev tools console (usually found by pressing F12). If this doesn't display the current version either clear your cache or reinstall.

## Posting an issue

**Issues that don't provide the necessary information listed below may not get a reply and will be closed until the info is provided.**
**Include as much of the following as you can to help me replicate and investigate your issue:**

- A copy/paste of your Custom Header config (found in "Raw Config Editor" or ui-lovelace.yaml)<br>**Use the tip at the end of this page to format it correctly.**
- Any errors relevant to Custom Header found in the HA logs
- Any relevant errors found in your browsers dev console (F12)
- The version of Home Assistant and Custom Header you are using
- The browsers or apps that are affected (i.e. Firefox, Chrome, Chrome Mobile, iOS HA Companion app, etc.)
- Installation method (HACS or manual)
  <br>

**When pasting in your config always place 3 backticks <code>```</code> above the first line of your config and after the last line. Doing this will format it correctly so that I may find any formatting errors in your config.**<br>
