## Issues

Issues should be posted to the GitHub page and never the forums. This makes tracking the issues easier and they will be resolved quicker.

In order for me to investigate issues, please provide the following information when submitting:

* A copy/paste of your Custom Header config
* Any errors relevent to Custom Header found in the HA logs
* Any relevent errors found in your browsers dev console (usually found by hitting F12)
* The version of Home Assistant and Custom Header you are using
* The browser type your are using

When pasteing in your config always place 3 backticks ```` ``` ```` above the first line and after the last line. Doing this will format it correctly so that I can find any errors in your config.

Issues that don't provide the nessisary information may not get a reply and will ultimately be closed.

[You may submit your issues here.](https://github.com/maykar/custom-header/issues/new/choose)
