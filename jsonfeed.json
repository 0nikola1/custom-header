Fork and clone the repository.\n2. Open the [devcontainer][devcontainer] and run `npm start`.\n3. The compiled `.js` file will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/custom-header.js` and in the `dist` directory.\n4. On a running Home Assistant installation add this to your Lovelace `resources:`\n\n```yaml\n- url: 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/custom-header.js'\n  type: module\n```\n\n_Change \"127.0.0.1\" to the IP of your development machine._\n\n### Bonus\n\nIf you need a fresh test instance you can install a fresh Home Assistant instance inside the devcontainer as well.\n\n1. Run the command `dc start`.\n2. Home Assistant will install and will eventually be running on port `9123`\n\n<!--Links -->\n\n[devcontainer]: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers","index":1338}],"installation":[{"title":"HACS","id":"hacs","url":"./#installation/hacs","content_html":"---\ntitle: HACS\nindex: 2\n---\n\n## Installation with HACS\n\n[HACS](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs) is a custom integration that allows you to search for, discover, install, and manage custom additions to Home Assistant.\n\n1.
